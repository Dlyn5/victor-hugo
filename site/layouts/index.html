  Hooray üéâ - I've completed my answers!
</p>

<p>
  Using the site you‚Äôve made, post answers to the following questions: 
<BR>
<h1>Q1:  Rank your 5 favorite, and 5 least favorite, activities from this list:  </h1><BR>
A-1:  My 5 favorite,
1.	Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
2.	Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers
3.	Respond to 50+ support requests via email or chat most days
4.	Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
5.	Manage a Support team
<BR>
A-2:  My 5 least favorite
1.	Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter
2.	Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup
3.	Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub
4.	Help manage communications during a service outage
5.	Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers

<h1>Q2:  What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?</h1><BR>
A:  My favorite thing is that I‚Äôm always learning while enjoy helping and teaching others.  I‚Äôm a firm believer in open communications with your company, team and customers.  Notes or tips and tricks should be openly shared and not hoarded. 

<h1>Q3:  What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Provide either some constructive criticism or some points that impressed you.  Be honest!  ‚ÄúIt sucked‚Äù isn‚Äôt a wrong answer unless you don‚Äôt elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)</h1><BR>
A:  I really liked the Docs section and the quality of your information provided. This may be very difficult for a non-technical person as the information is written for a base line of technical knowledge.  For example at the top of the Welcome page, third line is sample code of npm install netlify-cli -g;.  When go to the command line tool section, it states, you‚Äôll need npm. There is no reference to https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm or  https://nodejs.org/en/ or how to install npm.  NPM aka node package manager.


<h1>Q4:  Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h1><BR>
A:  I used StaticGen to create my site(s), first looking for the most simple where I was familiar with the language all ready (just trying to look good) and templates that showed "Deploy to Netlify".  I wanted to know if was simple enough not knowing the language so I set up two sites. Jekyll-base https://dlyn5-wonderful.netlify.com/ aka http://wonderful.darlalyn.me (at the time of writing, it works in Safari but not Chrome) and victor-hugo https://dlyn5.netlify.com aka https://darlalyn.me/.  The first site I used the Deploy to Netlify option and other site I did from the Netlify site to pull the info from my GitHub account.
<BR>
I setup my domain darlalyn.me with a subdomain wonderful.darlalyn.me (don‚Äôt worry it only cost me $3.50) under GoDaddy.  I was challenged with the DNS settings and wondering if I set them correctly, or was I stuck in that 24 hour mark to update.  I was ultimately able to verify and access all sites through the Netlify.com and the darlalyn.me links, in Safari.  Now I have to learn more to see what it‚Äôs like editing and actually developing the site through your service.
<BR>
Lastely used the Netlify template to create dlyn5-blog.netlify.com that is then linked with my own domain to blog.darlalyn.me.  I posted all of my answers to the https://darlalyn.me site.  The resources I used to complete this was the on-line docs and my own html knowledge.

<h1>Q5:  Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h1><BR>
A:  On the NPM site https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/searching-for-packages I think this section of documentation was well done for the following reasons.
1.	Ease of navigation
2.	Links to expand sample data so you don‚Äôt have read through or scroll past it, if that‚Äôs not what you need.  This make scan the document quicker.
3.	Well written and easy to follow.

<h1>Q6:  Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h1><BR>
A:  In one word ‚ÄúSECURITY‚Äù.   When using SSL/HTTPS your data that is transmitted is securely encrypted between yourself and the server you are connecting too. Preventing a man in the middle attack, where your data is sent in clear text (under HTTP) and can be seen, scanned or captured by a hacker or other person/agency. HTTP/2 is a major new version of the HTTP protocol supported in all major web browsers. It adds compression, pipelining, and other features that help make web pages load faster.  All web browsers require sites to use HTTPS encryption if they want these useful new HTTP/2 features. Modern devices have dedicated hardware to process the AES encryption HTTP requires. This means that HTTPS should actually be faster than HTTP.  While browsers are making HTTPS attractive with new features, Google is making HTTP unattractive by penalizing websites for using it. Google plans to flag websites that don‚Äôt use HTTPS as unsafe in Chrome, and Google wants to prioritize websites that use HTTPS in Google search results. This provides a strong incentive for websites to migrate to HTTPS.   

<h1>Q7:  Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users.</h1><BR>
A:  First you need to address what DNS is for and why it is so important.  I explain this in reference to the Post Office being the authoritative source for people‚Äôs names, location and addresses in order to provide mail routing and delivery to your home or office.  Your IP address is equivalent to your house street address and your web site domain is the names of the people who live at that address like Mr. & Mrs. Jones.  This data is maintained in the directory to provide items to be routing and delivered to you.  The Post Office or DNS is able to search for the user friendly name of ‚Äòapple.com‚Äô and direct the traffic to the mailing address of 17.178.96.59 (your IP address).  Rather than needing to know everyone‚Äôs physical address or IP address, DNS allows you remember only the user friendly names aka web site URL name.  
The second issue would be knowing the record types and updating you‚Äôre A or CNAME for the web site only and not impacting your email delivery.  


<h1>Q8:  A customer writes in saying their ‚Äúsite won‚Äôt build‚Äù.  Compose:
your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer, without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case, but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.</h1><BR>

<h1> Q9:  (optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from ‚Äú/netlify/anything‚Äù to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?</h1><BR>
A:  Not in that syntext.  If you wanted to redirect the full site you would enter into the _redirect file https://netlify.com/ https://www.google.com/search?q=anything and if that site is a Jekyll site then you need to add in a line item that read ‚Äúinclude: [_redirects]‚Äù into the _config.yml File.

<h1>Q10:  (optional/bonus) Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</h1><BR>
A:  Nothing that I can think of at the moment.  So far I would say that you are right on point.
